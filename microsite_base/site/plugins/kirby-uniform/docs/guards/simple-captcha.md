# Simple captcha Guard

The simple captcha guard uses an inlined data URI captcha (based on [this library](https://github.com/Gregwar/Captcha)) for spam protection. Head over to the [repository of the guard](https://codeberg.org/refbw/uniform-simple-captcha) to learn how to install and use it. Thanks [**@S1SYPHOS**](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS)!
